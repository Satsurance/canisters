# `Satsurance Canister`
## Description
Satsurance is an insurance protocol for Bitcoin projects. Liquidity providers (LPs) lock their ckBTC to underwrite risk and earn BTC-denominated yield funded by insurance premiums. Pool managers price Bitcoin protocols based on their risk and balance the poolâ€™s product portfolio.
